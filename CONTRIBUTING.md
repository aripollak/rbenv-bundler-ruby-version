Contributions are welcome. Pull requests should include test coverage for the bugfix or feature.  To run tests, install [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), then run `bats test` in the base directory of this plugin.

I would like to keep this plugin small and simple, which means I may not merge new features. So please check with me before starting work on a large feature.
